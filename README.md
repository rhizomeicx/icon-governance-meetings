# ICON P-Rep Community Meetings Guidelines.

**ICON P-Rep Community Meetings** are online video meetings hosted each two weeks between the P-Rep Teams via [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/). These meetings are separate from ICON Foundation's Governance monthly meeting, and will focus on smaller topics within the community.

All P-Rep teams are invited to participate in the meetings as *panelists* and any ICONist that would like to participate can do so as a *viewer* having the option of using the meeting chat to give their opinions on the topics discussed.

The goal of these meetings are:

* Foster discussions about Governance between P-Reps and have a platform to discuss Governance and ICON overall related topics in real time and "face to face".
* To provide ICONist with a regular video resource to keep updated on ICON overall important topics
* Allow ICONist in general to see each P-Rep team opinions and recommendations in regard to Governance

## How to Submit a Meeting Topic

A couple of days before each meeting a forum post will be published to allow any and all P-Rep teams and/or ICONists to submit discussion topics for the next upcoming meeting.

If you are an ICONist and would like to have access to the meeting you can post a comment in the forum post and request access to it, if you are a P-Rep and would like to be notified automatically before all the meetings leave a comment in this thread to grant you access to the Meeting Announcement channel on Telegram.

To ensure we stay on track, please join the meeting 10-15 minutes ahead of time to test your audio and video (optional). Currently we allow all P-Rep team members to join but in the future depending on attendance we might limit participation as panelist to only one member from each P-Rep team.

If you have any recommendation about meeting guidelines, or you would like to suggest a rotation of the hour at which the meeting takes place please leave a comment, I will update this comment to keep it updated but since the forum has time limitations on editing comments, the most updated version of this guidelines will always be found in the following github document:
